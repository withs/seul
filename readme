[-] seul

seul is a set of headers and a lib that can be used as a base for new project (mostly my projects ^^).
it's goal it's at term to not rely on system libs and stdlib for its core component (freestanding build with nostdlib).
cross platform, cross compile and simplicity.
+ the most important part it's main goal to to learn and touch many aspect of system and programing in general.

*this project is on an early stage, not all platforms/archs are implemented, and very few features are implemented too

[-] build

- build for current platform/arch.
gmake all
- build for another platform/arch, (see notes.txt to see supported targets).
gmake all TARGET_TRIPLE="x86_64-unknown-openbsd"
- build and link to research/playground.c, it can be used to quickly try a feature or develop.
gmake playground

*artifacts should be present on ./target/<target-triple>/libseuil.a or ./target/<target-triple>/playground (yes it look kinda like rust but it look very sweet :] ) 
*not all targets are implemented yet
*if you are not using bsd use 'make' instead of 'gmake' or 'nmake' for windows (not tested)
*header only build is planned
