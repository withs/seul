[-] seul

seul is a set of headers and a lib that can be used as a base for new project (my projects ^^).
it's goal it's at term to not rely on system libs and stdlib for its core component (freestanding build with nostdlib).
cross platform, cross compile and simplicity.the most important part is to allow me to learn and touch many aspect of system and programing in general.

*this project is on an early stage, not all platforms/archs are implemented, and very few features are implemented too

[-] build

- build for current platform/arch.
gmake all
- build for another platform/arch, (see bellow to see supported targets).
gmake all TARGET_TRIPLET="x86_64-unknown-openbsd"
- build and link to research/playground.c, it can be used to quickly try a feature or develop.
gmake playground

*artifacts should be present on ./target/<target-triple>/libseuil.a or ./target/<target-triple>/playground (yes it look kinda like rust but it look very sweet :] ) 
*not all targets are implemented yet
*if you are not using bsd use 'make' instead of 'gmake' or 'nmake', use make from unxtools on windows
*header only build is planned
